(You will be able to come back to this decision if you don't like specific value, but once selected - it stays permanent.

 plato_values.EVTOPTC23: "Equality"
 plato_values.EVTNAME24: "Liberty"
 plato_values.EVTDESC24: "The Liberty national value represents a common national interest in the propagation and defense of human liberty. A liberty-focused nation is often filled with intensely independent people who do not easily bow to their government's demandsor to foreign invaders.

 plato_values.EVTDESC25: "The Order national value represents a common national interest in an orderly, law-abiding society. Order-based societies value tradition, law, and hierarchy above all else.

 plato_values.EVTOPTB25: "Let us reconsider."
 plato_values.EVTNAME26: "Equality"
 plato_values.EVTDESC26: "The Equality national value represents a common national interest in an equal society. The definition and extent of this equality may be different from place to place, but the idea that the nation is one of equals, each with common stake in its survival, is a powerful one. These populations can be readily shaped into large conscript armies, but their economic prowess and organization is dulled by their zealous focus on equality over efficiency.\n\n§RSocialist§! and §RCommunist§! movements will gain greater popularity."

 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC51: "Followers of $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith in [Root.GetName] demand greater autonomy in practicing their faith. Men and Women demand that they are allowed to practice their religion the way their $CULTURE$ ancestors did. Though our religion does allow quite amount of freedom of practice, priesthood may get upset, as such autonomy will lower their status and control over the country."

 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME52: "Christianity and Violence"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC52: "Peace, compassion and forgiveness of wrongs done by others are key elements of Christian teaching. However, Christians have struggled since the days of the Church fathers with the question of when the use of force is justified. Throughout history, biblical passages have been used to justify the use of force against heretics, sinners and external enemies. Many theologians and scholars in our country believe that we should stay true to Christian dogma and refrain from bloodshed and violence."

 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTC52: "He who is not angry when there is a just cause for anger is immoral."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME53: "Renaissance and Humanism"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC53: "In some ways, humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of 'Studia Humanitatis', the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy and rhetoric. The Renaissance also brought and emphasis upon going back to the original sources. Many of the Greek classics made their way to western Europe as the great Greek libraries of eastern Roman Empire were moved west to be kept safe from the advancing Muslim armies. Scholars began to want to read these classics in the original language. Now, Renaissance has come to our country too..."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTA53: "Let us welcome these new ideas and scholars!"

 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTE53: "Us, pagans, can learn a lot from these scholars!"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTF53: "Humanism is an approach to life based on our common humanity."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME54: "Society denounces reforms"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC54: "Our orderly and traditional society denounces our recent government policies and reforms, and demands that we refrain from drastic changes in our society."

 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME55: "Society ready for war."

 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTA55: "Excellent."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME57: "Society rejects Republicanism"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC57: "Despite our efforts, more and more people in our country dislike our current government, favoring more traditional and less... equal society. Many conservatives see the Republic as weak form of rule and more conservative politicians gain popularity. Some reactionary movements even proclaim that we need to establish a monarchy."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTA57: "Interesting..."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME58: "Rising Social inequality"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC58: "In the past years, the social inequality has worsened quite a bit. The nobility gains power and wealth and our overall economy thrives, but many street spokesmen and foreigners agitate our peasants and lower class to take up arms and overthrow the opressive regime. While this is unacceptable, we must react to rising social tensions in this regard."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTA58: "Let us try to ease their situation."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTB58: "Hierarchy is what keeps [Root.GetName] growing strong."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTC58: "It is the provocateurs and agents that must be dealt with."

 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME60: "Society dislikes zealous ruler"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC60: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has many traits. One of the striking ones is him being a religous zealot.

 varant_events.EVTDESC1: "Establishing the Empire of Varant and Kvaadir dynasty was meticulous and near impossible task, despite the power vacuum in the region. More so, instead of Sunni or Shia sultan, the Empire was founded by zealous Zoroastrians from Zanjan. It was through exceptional leadership, magnamity of soul and tolerant rule Kvaadirs managed to establish one of the largest Empires the Middle East has ever seen. Strong our country may seem, it faces severe religious problems - state religion of Zoroastrianism is still followed by minority in the country and muslim rebels and separatists either want to see the ruler become muslim or see Varant fall. Recently, more and more imams, emirs and muslim merchants come to you, demanding that their religion must be respected and spread."

 varant_events.EVTNAME2: "Preachers"
 varant_events.EVTDESC2: "Muslims are allowed to freely practice their faith in the country. Many clergymen interpret this freedom as also freedom to openly spread the word of their God and invite more potential followers to their faith.

 varant_events.EVTOPTA2: "Let them."

 varant_events.EVTDESC3: "Despite our previous choices and actions on this matter, muslims recently started to raid Zoroastrian villages and temples and murder your councilors and advisors following this faith.

 varant_events.EVTOPTA3: "This madness must stop. Peace must be achieved."

 varant_events.EVTOPTA4: "Their demands are understandable - we will grant them this Liberty."
 varant_events.4.a.tt: "Taxes will decrease for muslim provinces."
 varant_events.EVTOPTB4: "Such freedoms will endanger Order in the country."
 varant_events.4.b.tt: "Taxation will remain the same."

 varant_events.EVTDESC6: "At this point, Muslims demand that any religious conversion are stopped whatsoever. Many wise scholars and even your own advisors suggest that you agree. If your choice is in their favor, religious conversion will stop whatseover, but at least there is hope that religious peace will finally begin."
 varant_events.EVTOPTA6: "What?! This is madness!"
 varant_events.6.a.tt: "Your refusal will have consequences."

Okay, maybe not, but you must take into account the fact that the Mod uses almost every feature the game has to offer, including the ones that were added in the DLC (policies, innovativeness, government reforms, personal deities, etc.).

I was always annoyed by how majority of the Europa Universalis IV players mindlessly conquered province after province (AKA map painting simulator) without ever thinking about playing tall and developing your country, focusing on diplomacy, espionage and trade. \n\nThe §RAnti-Blobbing§! feature was introduced to restrict players (and AI) from becoming abnormally large; to make nations eventually shatter over time (The Rise and Fall feature of the mod); to make conquerors think and plan their expansion more carefully and to encourage tall play."

These values not only add permanent (until you form another country, For example, forming United States shifts your national value to Liberty, regardless of your current one) §Gbonuses§! and §Rpenalties§!, but also add different events and options, government reforms (For example, Minarchism reform is available only to Liberty national value), idea groups and relations with other countries."

 wiki_event.EVTNAME11: "Lore"
 wiki_event.EVTDESC11: "Initially, Platos Europa began as a fix for my converted CK II game. I was Latgale (and later changed to play as Israel, Norway and Andalusia). My session was really interesting and I thought it would be fun to release it as a mod. Obviously, CK 2 converter is flawed and I had to do some changes to the map. I also wanted to change some national ideas, as new countries had atrocious Basic Ideas, so I used my games history and shaped the national ideas in a way, that would portray my gameplay. \n\nChange after change, this mod grew, and eventually become a Platos Europa you know now. New countries have their national ideas, (some are even blessed with missions) events and government types (Latgalia, Israel, Athens). The old ones were also affected, for example  Austria. Austria is no longer ruled by Habsburgs, but by Babenbergs. Hence, their national ideas are also changed. As of the outside Europe world, I also used my imagination on Asia, Africa and even Americas. True, these regions were not changed as much as Europe (mostly due to my limited knowledge of history of these regions), but I did try to do my best to create a semi-realistic (yeah, I know how this sounds) and fun alternative scenario. I hope I succeeded."

 wiki_event.EVTNAME13: "Avoiding Anti-Blobbing penalties"
 wiki_event.EVTDESC13: "While §RAnti-Blobbing§! does restrict everyones expansion (including AI) it does not permit one to blob completely. You can still try to form Rome (you absolute madman), but now you have to work harder and smarter. Your main foe is unrest, and hence you must focus on avoiding it. Seek advisors, ideas, religions that will help you lower it. A better idea would be to use Vassals, Personal Unions and Client states instead, as Vassal territories do not count towards §RAnti-Blobbing§! (annexing them does, however). \n\nFinally, as the technology progresses, §RAnti-Blobbing§! slowly stops being an issue. While the first three centuries may seem like a cluster-fuck of states growing and exploding, the end game is more stable in this regard and states actually begin to turn into blobs (while still being affected by §RAnti-Blobbing§!)."

 wiki_event.EVTDESC14: "Mostly  Ideas. Large amount of countries have their national ideas altered, for example, Austria. Brandenburg no longer has Prussian ideas and has their own unique idea set. Iceland no longer has basic ideas and has their own. As for the Rest  bonuses were altered more or less. For example, All countries that had reduced unrest national idea, have the bonuses reduced from -2 to -1. Lot of countries were nerfed, a lot more were buffed (not because of balance, but because of lore). Changes also include §Breligions, government reforms, policies, decisions, events, province terrain, age abilities and buildings§!. \n\nQuite important change is unique §Bprovince modifiers§!, such as Alhambra, Damascus steel, Mount St. Michel and various Holy Sites (Kent, Sjaelland, Baghdad, Mt. Athos, etc.). Apart from that, changes also include different country colors and flags, as well as historical ideas. §BNew cultures§! were also added, most importantly, for Turkey (Turkish has become a culture group)."

 wiki_event.EVTNAME15: "Mod Compatibility"
 wiki_event.EVTDESC15: "I §RHIGHLY§! advise you not to. Platos Europa is a global overhaul that changes so many aspects in the game, that it would be hard to find a mod that would be compatible with it. You may try some at your own risk, but bear in mind that any future issues that arise from them I wont be able to fix for you. The only §Gsafe§! mods to use are graphics and visuals ones, such as Unit and building Model changes or map ones, such as Terratum Orbis or Graphical Map Improvements (I used both of them with Platos Europa and everything worked like a charm). The mods that add more provinces are advised against as well. The alternative flags mods are also not recommended, as the mod changes them too. Instead of causing yourself headaches with other mods, better share your thoughts and ideas with me on what should be added in the future."

 wiki_event.EVTNAME16: "Interesting Countries"
 wiki_event.EVTDESC16: "Since in Platos Europa size is no longer the most important factor of strength (because of §RAnti-Blobbing§!), country strength now lies in their National Ideas, Development, Government, Events and Missions. There are several countries that have the potential to become a major powers (or they already are). Now you can tell which countries are strong by their size (Andalusia, Japan, Navarasids), I will list some countries that may not seem too powerful at first.\n\n§BLatgalia§! has powerful and special national ideas, government and religion, all of which contribute to their military might. Despite having weak economy, they have the power to punch way above their size and can quickly become a major power in the region. They are in best position to form United Baltic Provinces  a country with powerful national ideas and large mission tree.\n\n§BNorway§!, similarly to Denmark in base EU4, controls majority of Scandinavia and part of Britain. Holding the throne of England may be difficult, but if they manage to secure it and use their colonial bonuses, they can become a foe to be reckoned with.\n\n§BVarant§! does not have it easy at the start because of the low religious unity and incoming revolts and turmoil, but if they do manage to fix all their internal issues, they can secure their status of the strongest country in the game and give nightmares to everyone from Mediterranean to the Pacific. More so, if they remain Zoroastrian, they can eventually re-establish the mighty Achaemenid Empire.\n\nLastly, you may also give smaller nations a shot. While the large countries may grow and expand, they will eventually break down and explode, but the small nations will thrive (if they survive, of course). These include Iceland, Riga, Malta, Oeselians and Athens. If you like tall play, try them out."
