 plato_venetian_arsenal: "Venetian Arsenal"
 desc_plato_venetian_arsenal: "The Arsenal of Venice, begun about 1104 AD, was eventually a sprawling complex of shipyards, armories, and weapons shops. Built to serve the needs of the Venetian Navy upon which the Republic relied for both its independence and its lucrative sea trade routes, it was termed the most important example of a large production complex with a centralized structure of the pre-industrial civilization. Different areas of the Arsenal produced a prefabricated ship part, armaments, rope, sails and everything needed to put together a warship in a single day if necessity demanded. A state-owned forest in the Montello hills provided the timber and tar. The Porto Magna (great gate) to the Arsenal was added c. 1460, from a design by the artist Jacopo Bellini, the first Classical Revival structure built in Venice; two stone lions, captured in Greece, were added to the entrance in 1687 to awe visitors. The Arsenal also, when not launching warships to beat down Venices challengers in the Mediterranean, produced most of the Venetian merchant ships bringing wealth back to the city-state  to build more ships."

The al-Hamra (literally, the red one), so named for its red clay fortress walls, was lavish  at least by European standards of the time  with all the comforts, including indoor plumbing. It integrated the natural beauty of the spot with structures and gardens designed and outfitted by the finest Muslim, Jewish, and even Christian craftsmen and artisans of the region. Among its most striking aspects, many of the interior walls and columns are inscribed in carved flowing Arabic script with poetry and verses from the Quran."

Besides St. Aubert's skull, the Mont also was repository for bits of St. Petroc and St. Olaf and other holy relics. The place did have a practical purpose; its high walls, turrets and position made it of strategic worth  and many a French king stationed a small garrison (all that was needed) there. At low tide, it was readily accessible to pilgrims eager to give up a coin or two to be blessed; at high tide, the incoming sea would strand or drown any attacking force."
 plato_notre_dame: "Notre Dame"

 plato_citystate_alquarvan: "Center of Learning"
 desc_plato_citystate_alquarvan: "Founded by the Umayyad caliph Muawiya around 670 AD, Kairouan  located on the north coast of Africa  would become one of Sunni Islams most important centers of scholarship and education, its university attracting scholars from across the Arabic world. Thus, its fame spread even to Northern Europe  although tales of its wealth were greatly overblown. Following the mass conversion of the Berbers by the Prophets words, they captured Kairouan with its luxurious gardens and expansive olive groves in 745. Power struggles saw various rulers, some benevolent and some less so. In the reign of Imam Sahnun and Asad ibn al-Furat, palaces, fortifications and waterworks were built, making the town ever more famous. Envoys from the courts of Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire returned with fabulous tales of Kairouans great gardens and libraries.

The definition and extent of this equality may be different from place to place, but the idea that the nation is one of equals, each with common stake in its survival, is a powerful one. These populations can be readily shaped into large conscript armies, but their economic prowess and organization is dulled by their zealous focus on equality over efficiency."
